                        <h2>About the Harmony Foundation</h2>
                        <p>The Harmony Foundation was created in 1989 by Keegan and Christain, who had a strong passion for music. Keegan had grown up in a more low income area, where the local school district had tried numerous times to get rid of their music programs. [Something about Christain]. The two were heartbroken by how music programs aren't globally accessible today, and with how much the two valued music, they couldn't let these struggles continue. The two started working together to find any near by communities that were struggling to maintain musical programs, and tried to help them as much as possible.</p>

                            <h2>Our Work</h2>
                            <p>Since 1989, the Harmony Foundation has rigorously worked towards bringing musical programs to the less fortunate communities. With the support of numerous generous indivduals, we've been able to collect and distribute musical instruments to less fortunate school districts, and grow a catalog of various musical arrangements to teach local youth. Additionally, thanks to our many talented volunteers we've been able to provide the local youth with instructors for some of the most commonly played instruments, as well as form various local orchestras and choirs.
