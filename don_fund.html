                    <h2>Donations</h2>
                    <p>The Harmony Foundations accepts two kinds of donations:</p>

                        <li><b>Monetary Donations: </b><i>For monetary cash donations,</i> you may bring the cash to any supervisor or manager with the Harmony Foundation. <i>For digital monetary donations,</i> we have a [APP PAGE] that you may send money through.</li>
                        <li><b>Equipment Donations: </b>If you would like to donate a musical instrument or other equipment needed for musical perfomances, we ask that you please schedule an <a href="equipment.html">inspection appointment</a> to see if we are able to accept your donation.</li>

                    <h2>Fundraisers</h2>
                    <p>The Harmony Foundation hosts fundraisers for our cause year-round. All of our proceeds go towards funding music programs for low-income communities. Some of our recurring funraisers include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Semi-Annual Concerts:</b> We host two concerts a year for our Harmony Orchestra, Choir, and Band, where our hard working youth display their growing passion for music. With an entrance fee of just $10 per person, we're able to continue spreading the world of music!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Donations</h2>
                    <p>As an independent, non-profit organization, most of our work is only made possible by the generous individuals who volunteer their time and donate resources to the Harmony Foundation. If you believe in our cause and want to see more of the less fortunate youth thriving in a world of music, please consider donating through one of three methods:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Monetary Cash:</b> We accept monetary cash donations for the Harmony Foundation. The process is is rather simple; you may bring the cash in an envelope to any supervisor or manager of the Harmony Foundation.</li>
                        <li><b>Digitally Monetary:</b> For donating money, we also have a [APP PAGE] page that you may digitally send money through.</li>
                        <li><b>Equipment and Instruments:</b> We also accept donations that directly provide musical instruments or any other equipment needed for musical perfomances and practices. However, we do ask that you first schedule an <a href="equipment.html">inspection appointment</a>, to ensure that your donation can be accepted by the Harmony Foundation.</li>
                    </ul>
